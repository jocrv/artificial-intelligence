A fuzzy system deals with fuzzy sets to do the tasks of fuzzyifying real-world scalar values ​​so that they can be manipulated as linguistic entities and, after applying inference rules that are expressed with these linguistic entities, but actually deal with the membership values ​​produce, through a process called defuzzyfication, the scalar values ​​that apply to the output to the real world.
From this statement, the following characteristics of the components of a fuzzy system can be extracted:
I- Rules are provided by experts or extracted from numerical data
II- The defuzzifier transforms the fuzzy set obtained by Inference and transforms it into a precise value.
III- In the inference, the typical value is weighed against its degree of relevance.

Choose the correct alternative.

Only item III is correct.
Only items II and III are correct.
Items I, II and III are correct.  TRUE
Only item II is correct.
Only items I and III are correct.

Fuzzy inference is a logical relation that obeys the same truth table of the ___________ Implication of traditional propositional logic (crisp logic). The difference is that in crisp logic, the rule is triggered only if ________ is ________ and in fuzzy logic the rule is triggered when the premise has a membership degree of _________ zero. The correct sequence is represented in:
Modus Ponens, conclusion, true, different from
Modus Ponens, premise, true, different from   TRUE
Modus Tollens, premise, false, different from
Modus Ponens, premise, false, equal to
Modus Tollens, conclusion, true, equal to


Let x = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and A and B are two fuzzy subsets of X, given by the membership functions µA and µB, respectively.

x 0 1 2 3 4
µA(x) 1 0.5 0.3 0.9 1
µB(x) 0 0.2 0.4 0.3 0

Considering the calculation formula suggested by Zadeh for the logical operators AND and OR, what is the result of the relevance of the values ​​of the following three expressions: µA(0) AND µB(0); µA(2) AND µB(2); µA(2) OR µB(2); µA(3) OR µB(4)

1; 0.4; 0.3; 0.9
0; 0.3; 0.4; 0.9  TRUE 
1; 0.4; 0.4; 0
0; 0.3; 0.4; 1
1; 0.2; 0.3; 0

Regarding fuzzy logic, we can state that the process transforms linguistic values ​​into fuzzy logic values ​​is: ______________________. Mark the correct option:
Relevance
Fuzzification TRUE
Boolean
Inference
defuzzification

In a Fuzzy system the inference is responsible for (check the correct alternative):
Perform the combination of rules and input values  TRUE
Apply the rules that deal with linguistic input values
Transform the fuzzy sets generated by applying the rules
Produce a desired scalar output
Transform the entry into memberships used for activating rules

In fuzzy inference:

The rule is a composition of Fuzzy relations where the first relation is a fuzzy set (possibly resulting from a Fuzzy operation)

and the second relationship is one of implication.


Check the correct alternative.

Both statements are incorrect.
The first statement is incorrect and the second is correct.
The first statement is correct and the second is incorrect.
Both statements are correct, but they are uncorrelated.
Both statements are correct and the second complements the first TRUE



 


4.
For fuzzy systems, check the option that indicates a defuzzification method.
load center
Minimum maximum
center of the highs
Average of the maximums TRUE
Minimum average



 


5.
To calculate the implication relationship, the most used form is suggested by:
Zadeh
von Newman
Tsukamoto
Mandani TRUE
Takagi-Sugeno

The defuzzification process produces a precise output from the fuzzy set of output obtained by the inference system.

Check the item that is not a defuzzification method.
Modified height
Area Center
Average of Maximums
Average of Lows TRUE
centroid
