A fuzzy system deals with fuzzy sets to do the tasks of fuzzyifying real-world scalar values ​​so that they can be manipulated as linguistic entities and, after applying inference rules that are expressed with these linguistic entities, but actually deal with the membership values ​​produce, through a process called defuzzyfication, the scalar values ​​that apply to the output to the real world.
From this statement, the following characteristics of the components of a fuzzy system can be extracted:
I- Rules are provided by experts or extracted from numerical data
II- The defuzzifier transforms the fuzzy set obtained by Inference and transforms it into a precise value.
III- In the inference, the typical value is weighed against its degree of relevance.

Choose the correct alternative.

Only item III is correct.
Only items II and III are correct.
Items I, II and III are correct.  TRUE
Only item II is correct.
Only items I and III are correct.
