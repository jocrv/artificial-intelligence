Operation with mutation: function with objective topic 
Evaluation function or objective function or fitness function, is a specific function that represents the set of all possible combinations of the components of a solution.
// using all maximum values for function

Consider a genetic algorithm that operates on three individuals A, B, C, described respectively by the binary vectors A = [11011000], B = [00010000], C = [11001101], generating two new individuals D = [11011101] and E = [11001000] The new individuals were generated through:
Crossover through the midpoint of individuals A and C. TRUE 
Crossover through the midpoint of individuals A and C followed by a one-bit mutation in each new individual (D and E).
Crossover through the midpoint of individuals B and C followed by a one-bit mutation in each new individual (D and E).
Crossover through the midpoint of individuals A and B followed by a one-bit mutation in each new individual (D and E).
Crossover through the midpoint of individuals A and B.



Consider the problem of maximizing the function f(x) = 3x+2 in domain [0, 127], using an integer representation for x. How many bits should the chromosome consist of?
