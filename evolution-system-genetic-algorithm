Genetic algorithms are Artificial Intelligence search techniques and have had a broad impact on optimization problems such as circuit layout and service provision scheduling.

Regarding the most common version of this technique, consider the following statements.

I. The functioning of genetic algorithms begins with a set of randomly generated k states called a population.

II. For each selected pair, a crossover point is chosen at random from the positions in the individual's chain.

III. The fitness function of each individual must define which is the best crossover point of the selected pairs.

IV. The mutation phase of genetic algorithms is mandatory and must follow a random order to guarantee advantages in their results.

 

Check the CORRECT alternative.

Only statements I, II and III are correct.
Only statements III and IV are correct.
Only statements I and IV are correct.
Only statements II, III and IV are correct. 
Only statements I and II are correct. TRUE

The general structure of a genetic algorithm is quite simple and consists of the iterative application of genetic operators. To stop the population evolution, a stopping criterion must be used. A group of Artificial Intelligence students tries to develop an optimization software with genetic algorithms and one of the problems found is precisely about the stopping criterion to be used. Some are being suggested. Review the suggestions below:

I - Maximum number of generations.

II - Maximum processing time.

III - Best individual of the current population, be satisfactory.

IV - Interruption of processing when the population no longer evolves after a certain number of consecutive generations.

Check the alternative that indicates which suggestions above can be used as stopping criteria in genetic algorithms:

Only I and II
Only I and III
Any suggestions TRUE 
Only I, II and IV 
Only I, III and IV

Regarding search techniques used in artificial intelligence, consider the following statements.

I. A genetic algorithm is a stochastic Hill Climbing search in which a large population of states is maintained. New states are generated by mutation and by crossover, which combines pairs of population states.
II. The search in width, in depth and of uniform cost are special cases of searching for the best choice (Best First).
III. Search A* expands nodes with minimum value to f(n) = g(n) + h(n). A* is complete and optimal, as long as it can be guaranteed that h(n) is admissible.

In relation to Genetic Algorithms, we can state that:

I - The selection processes of candidate solutions, used by genetic algorithms, seek to exclusively select the fittest candidates, totally discarding the least fit ones, in order to always maintain the best genetic characteristics always present in the population.

II - In a genetic algorithm, a population of individuals (chromosomes) represents a set of candidate solutions (population) to the problem that one seeks to optimize.

III - The choice of the initial population, for genetic algorithms, must be judicious, generating only individuals with a high degree of aptitude and not admitting any degree of randomness.

IV - The mutation genetic operator combines chromosomes from previously selected individuals, called parents, to form two new individuals, which have a high possibility of being more fit than their parents. Only the statements are correct:
